- 👋 Hi, I’m @gtancev.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization (i.e., data science).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning probabilistic artificial intelligence (gaussian processes, variational inference, reinforcement learning).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML/AI applied to chemical systems to create smart chemical systems.
- 📫 Contact me either on LinkedIn!
