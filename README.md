I am a scientist and engineer 
- specialized in mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization; 
- with a background in life sciences; 
- and further education in computer science with a major in machine intelligence. 

In the meantime, I have
- assisted pharmaceutical companies improve manufacturing processes via models and simulations; 
- supported physicians predict pediatric mortality by machine learning applied to clinical data; 
- enabled environmental authorities perform reliable air quality monitoring with low-cost sensors through the data-driven development of new protocols.
