I am a quantitative scientist with degrees in engineering and computer science - with a passion for optimizing existing products/processes or designing new ones through digitalization and innovation. For this purpose, I try to identify potential weaknesses and understand people's needs. I like to ask if and how the established can be rethought. When it comes to the conceptual design, I like to be inspired by others, as similar problems may have already been solved elsewhere. To elaborate solutions, I make use of hard skills such as data science and programming. Data (and algorithms) have become the heart of my craft, and I have learned to question whether the desired information is available at all. The philosophical aspects of my work are close to my heart because today's solutions can become tomorrow's problems. I firmly believe that with creativity, collaboration, and communication, great things can be created. Once the goal is set, I push to make sure it is achieved.
